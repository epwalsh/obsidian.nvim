# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! Please read this document to learn the various steps you should take before submitting a pull request.

## Local development

If you're using the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io) (LuaLS) you'll probably want to add `plenary.nvim` as a workspace library since we rely heavily on plenary throughout the codebase. You can do this by adding a `.luarc.json` configuration file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumneko/vscode-lua/master/setting/schema.json",
  "workspace.library": ["~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/plenary.nvim/"],
  "runtime.version": "Lua 5.1"
}
```

Make sure that the path there to plenary is correct for you.

## Keeping the CHANGELOG up-to-date

This project tries hard to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), and we maintain a [`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) with a format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). 
If your PR addresses a bug or makes any other substantial change, please be sure to add an entry under the "Unreleased" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
Entries should always be in the form of a list item under a level-3 header of either "Added", "Fixed", "Changed", or "Removed" for the most part.
If the corresponding level-3 header for your item does not already exist in the "Unreleased" section, you should add it.

## Formatting code

Lua code should be formatted using [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua). Once you have StyLua installed, you can run `stylua .` to automatically apply styling to all of the Lua files in this repo.

## Linting code

We use [luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) to lint the Lua code. Once you have `luacheck` installed, you can run `luacheck .` to get a report.

## Running tests

Tests are written in the `test/` folder and are run using the [Plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) test harness. Since Plenary is a dependency of Obsidian.nvim, you probably already have it installed somewhere. To run the tests locally you'll need to know where it's installed, which depends on your plugin manager. In my case I use `Lazy.nvim` which puts Plenary at `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/plenary.nvim/`.

Once you know where Plenary is, you can run the tests like this:

```bash
make test PLENARY=/path/to/your/plenary
```

## Building the Vim documentation

The Vim documentation lives at `doc/obsidian.txt`, which is automatically generated from the README using [panvimdoc](https://github.com/kdheepak/panvimdoc). **So please only commit documentation changes to the README, not `doc/obsidian.txt`.**

However you can test how changes to the README will affect the Vim doc by running panvimdoc locally.
To do this you'll need install `pandoc` (e.g. `brew install pandoc` on Mac) and clone [panvimdoc](https://github.com/kdheepak/panvimdoc). Then from the panvimdoc repo root, run:

```bash
./panvimdoc.sh --project-name obsidian --input-file ../../epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/README.md --description 'a plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian vault' --toc 'false' --vim-version 'NVIM v0.8.0' --demojify 'false' --dedup-subheadings 'false' --shift-heading-level-by '-1' && mv doc/obsidian.txt /tmp/
```

This will build the Vim documentation to `/tmp/obsidian.txt`.

> ‚ùó NOTE: *the exact arguments to `./panvimdoc.sh` may change over time. Please see `.github/workflows/pandvimdoc.yml` for reference.*
