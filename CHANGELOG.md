## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where creating a new note with `nvim-cmp` completion
  would cause `nvim-cmp` to stop working.

## [v1.7.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.7.0) - 2023-02-02

### Added

- Added support for [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as one of the possible fallbacks for the `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` command.
- Added `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to fuzzy-find a note by name in telescope/fzf _a la_ <C-O> in Obsidian.
- Added support for [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as one of the possible fallbacks for the `:ObsidianSearch` command.
- Added `:ObsidianFollowLink` and companion function `util.cursor_on_markdown_link`
- Added `:ObsidianLink` and `:ObsidianLinkNew` commands.
- Added configuration option `disable_frontmatter` for frontmatter disabling
- Added line-navigation to `:ObsidianOpen` via the Obsidian Advanced URI plugin
- Added `:ObsidianYesterday` command to open/create the previous working day daily note

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Note.from_lines` where the given path would be modified in place to be relative to the root, which caused a bug in `:ObsidianFollowLink`.
- Completion for creating new notes via nvim-cmp is now aware of daily notes, so when you start typing todays date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD, you get a "Create new" completion option for today's daily note if it doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed bug where `:ObsidianOpen` blocked the NeoVim UI on Linux.
- `:ObsidianOpen` should now work on Windows.
- Fixed URL encoding of space characters for better compatibility with external applications.
- Made more robust to unexpected types in frontmatter.
- Fixed edge case where frontmatter consisting of exactly one empty field would raise an exception.
- Fixed `:ObsidianFollowLink` not creating a new note when following a dangling link; matches behavior in the official Obsidian app.
- Fixed handling spaces in configured vault directory.
- Fixed `:ObsidianFollowLink` not considering the vault's root directory.
- Fixed bug where the note ID in the YAML frontmatter wasn't updated after the file is renamed.

### Changed

- The new note completion source will now create the new note in the same directory as the current note, regardless of the `notes_subdir` setting.

## [v1.6.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.6.1) - 2022-10-17

### Fixed

- Ensured vault directory along with optional notes and daily notes subdirectories are added to vim's `path` so you can `gf` to files in those directories.

## [v1.6.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.6.0) - 2022-10-14

### Added

- Added support for arbitrary fields in YAML frontmatter.
- Added configuration option `note_frontmatter_func` for customizing the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This can be set to a function that takes a single argument - an `obsidian.Note` object - and returns a YAML-serializable table.

### Changed

- Added folding and custom highlighting to backlinks window, and fixed window height.
- When the title of a note is changed, the title will automatically be added to note's aliases in the frontmatter on save.

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete functionality to be less sensitive to case.
- Made YAML frontmatter dumping functionality more robust.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.5.0) - 2022-10-12

### Changed

- Improved `:ObsidianBacklinks` command to use its own buffer type instead of the location list.
  It's now more readable.
- Removed save on write for `:ObsidianNew` and `:ObsidianToday` ([#32](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/32)).

### Fixed

- `:ObsidianOpen` now works on Linux.

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.4.0) - 2022-10-11

- Fixed bug with creating a new note with `nvim-cmp` completion where full settings
  weren't taken into account.
- Fixed a bug with `:ObsidianBacklinks` where the paths were incorrect.

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.3.0) - 2022-09-23

### Changed

- `plenary.nvim` is no longer required to be installed seperately. It's now bundled as a submodule.

## [v1.2.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2022-09-23

### Added

- Added setup configuration option `notes_subdir`. Use this if you want new notes to be put in a specific subdirectory of your vault.

### Changed

- Commands are no-longer setup lazily on `BufEnter` to a markdown file in your vault. Now they'll always be available.

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianNew` command for creating a new note with a given title.
- Added setup configuration option `note_id_func`, which can be set to a custom function for generating new note IDs. The function should take a single optional string argument, a title of the note, and return a string. The default method for generating new note IDs is to generate a Zettelkasten-like ID using a timestamp and some random letters.
