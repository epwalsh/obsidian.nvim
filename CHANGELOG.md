and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianPasteImg` for pasting images from the clipboard into notes. See the `attachments` configuration option for customizing the behavior of this command. Inspired by [md-img-paste.vim](https://github.com/ferrine/md-img-paste.vim) and [clipboard-image.nvim](https://github.com/ekickx/clipboard-image.nvim).
- Added `completion.prepend_note_path` and `completion.use_path_only` options (mutually exclusive with each other and `completion.prepend_note_id`).
- Added support for completing traditional markdown links instead of just wiki links.

### Changed

- Renamed `opts.ui.tick` to `opts.ui.update_debounce`, but the `tick` field will still be read for backwards compatibility.
- `:ObsidianOpen` will now open wiki links under the cursor instead of always opening the note of the current buffer.
- `:ObsidianBacklinks` will now show backlinks for the note of a wiki link under the cursor instead of always showing backlinks for the note of the current buffer.

### Fixed

- Ensure commands available across all buffers, not just note buffers in the vault.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2023-11-16

**Highlights:**

The long awaited `:ObsidianRename` command is here along with big improvements to our syntax add-ons! Wiki links, external links, and checklists look much better now out-of-the-box and can be easily customized! ü•≥

I recommend you use treesitter as a base markdown syntax highlighter, but obsidian.nvim is also compatible with traditional regex syntax highlighting.

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianRename` command.
- Added `:ObsidianTomorrow` command.
- Added optional offset to `:ObsidianToday` command. For example: `:ObsidianToday -1` to go to yesterday's daily note.
- Added configuration option `ui` for customizing obsidian.nvim's additional syntax highlighting and extmarks.
- Improved default additional syntax highlighting / concealing.
- Added default mapping `<leader>ch` for toggling check-boxes.

### Fixed

- Ensure additional syntax highlighting works with latest treesitter.

## [v1.16.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.16.1) - 2023-11-11

## [v1.16.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.16.0) - 2023-11-10

Major internal refactoring to bring performance improvements through async execution of search/find functionality, and general robustness improvements. üèéÔ∏èü§†

### Added

- Added `obsidian.async` module for internal use.

### Changed

- Re-implemented the native Lua YAML parser (`obsidian.yaml.native`). This should be faster and more robust now.
- Re-implemented search/find functionality to utilize concurrency via `obsidian.async` and `plenary.async` for big performance gains.
- Made how run shell commands more robust, and we also log stderr lines now.
- Submodules imported lazily.
- Changes to internal module organization.

### Fixed

- Fixed a completion bug (#212).
- Fixed a bug where the frontmatter of daily note template would be overwritten upon inserting the template.
- Skip templates directory when searching for notes.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with the latest `fzf.vim` and made running finders more robust in general.

### Removed

- Removed the `overwrite_mappings` option.

## [v1.15.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.15.0) - 2023-10-20

### Added

- The `overwrite_mappings` option, which sets the mappings in the config even if they already exist
- Added support for multiple vaults (#128)
- Added command to switch between vaults (#60)
- Added configuration option `yaml_parser` (a string value of either "native" or "yq") to change the YAML parser.

### Fixed

- Eliminated silent runtime errors on validation errors in `note.from_lines`.
- Fixed parsing YAML boolean values in frontmatter.
- Fixed parsing implicit null values in YAML frontmatter.

## [v1.14.2](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.2) - 2023-09-25

### Fixed

- Updated recommendation for how to configure mappings.

## [v1.14.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.1) - 2023-09-22

### Fixed

- Added back missing `util.find()` function.

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.0) - 2023-09-22

### Added

- Added config option `sort_by` to allow setting search result order by "path", "modified", "accessed", or "created".
- Added config option `sort_reversed` to allow setting search result sort reversed order. The default is `true`.
- Added an extra option for daily notes to allow changing the default title from "%B %-d, %Y" to other strings.
- Added a configuration option `daily_notes.template` for automatically using a specific template when creating a new daily note.
- Adding a configuration option `templates.substitutions` for defining custom template substitutions.

### Changed

- Minor change to the behavior of `:ObsidianNew`. The argument to this command can be in one of 3 different forms which determine the behavior of the command:
  1. A raw title without any path components, e.g. `:ObsidianNew Foo`. In this case the command will pass the title to the `note_id_func` and put the note in the default location.
  2. A title prefixed by a path component, e.g. `:ObsidianNew notes/Foo`. In this case the command will pass the title "Foo" to the `note_id_func` and put the note in the directory of the path prefix "notes/".
  3. An exact path, e.g. `:ObsidianNew notes/foo.md`. In this case the command will put the new note at the path given and the title will be inferred from the filename ("foo").

### Fixed

- A bug when following links when headers have a space.
- Fixed `ObsidianFollowLink` when the note path contains a block link (e.g. `[[foo#^Bar]]`).
- Fixed `:ObsidianOpen` doesn't work in WSL2
  - Use [wsl-open](https://gitlab.com/4U6U57/wsl-open)
- Improved completion start pattern to trigger anytime `[[` is typed.
- Fixed issue with parsing inline lists in YAML frontmatter when the items aren't wrapped in quotes.

## [v1.13.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.13.0) - 2023-08-24

### Added

- Added option `prepend_note_id` to allow disabling id generation for new notes.
- Added `mappings` configuration field.
- Added `open_notes_in` configuration field
- Added `backlinks` options to the config. The default is
  ```lua
  backlinks = {
    -- The default height of the backlinks pane.
    height = 10,
    -- Whether or not to wrap lines.
    wrap = true,
  },
  ```

### Changed

- (internal) Refactored daily note creation.
- obsidian.nvim will now automatically enable the 'gf' passthrough keybinding within your vault unless the 'gf' keybinding has already been overridden by you or another plugin or you override the 'mappings' configuration field.

### Fixed

- Fixed `template_pattern` not escaping special characters.
- Fixed new notes not getting passed args correctly
- Fixed `:ObsidianOpen` when note is in a subdirectory with the same name as the root vault directory.
- Fixed issue where `note_frontmatter_func` option was not used when creating new notes.

### Added

- Allow user to supply an argument to `ObsidianTemplate` to select a template.

### Changed

- Added `log_level` configuration option to suspend notifications.
- Added `completion.new_notes_location` configuration option to specify where newly created notes are placed in completion.

### Fixed

- Fixed creating new notes when the title of the note contains a path. Now that path will always be treated as relative to the vault, not the `notes_subdir`.
- Fixed `ObsidianFollowLink` when the note path contains a header link (e.g. `[[foo#Bar]]`).

## [v1.11.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.11.0) - 2023-06-09

### Added

- Added `finder` option for choosing a preferred finder backend.

### Fixed

- Removed annoying "skipped updating frontmatter" message on file write.

## [v1.9.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - 2023-04-22

- Fixed `nvim-cmp` completion for notes that have no `aliases` specified.
- `nvim-cmp` completion will search based on file names now too, not just contents.
- Fixed bug when `nvim-cmp` is not installed.
- Workaround error which prevented users from using `ObsidianOpen` when vault path was configured behind a link
- Detect URLs when following links and ignore them by default.

## [v1.8.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - 2023-02-16

### Changed

- [`lua-yaml`](https://github.com/exosite/lua-yaml) no-longer bundled as a git submodule. Code from that project has been copied and modified into it's own Lua submodule of `obsidian`.
- (BREAKING) 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' is no-longer bundled, so must be explicitly installed (e.g. Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' in your `init.nvim`).

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where creating a new note with `nvim-cmp` completion
  would cause `nvim-cmp` to stop working.
- Fixed bug where `disable_frontmatter` setting would be ignored for `:ObsidianNew` command.

## [v1.7.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.7.0) - 2023-02-02

### Added

- Added support for [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as one of the possible fallbacks for the `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` command.
- Added `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to fuzzy-find a note by name in telescope/fzf _a la_ <C-O> in Obsidian.
- Added support for [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as one of the possible fallbacks for the `:ObsidianSearch` command.
- Added `:ObsidianFollowLink` and companion function `util.cursor_on_markdown_link`
- Added `:ObsidianLink` and `:ObsidianLinkNew` commands.
- Added configuration option `disable_frontmatter` for frontmatter disabling

- Added `:ObsidianYesterday` command to open/create the previous working day daily note

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Note.from_lines` where the given path would be modified in place to be relative to the root, which caused a bug in `:ObsidianFollowLink`.
- Completion for creating new notes via nvim-cmp is now aware of daily notes, so when you start typing todays date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD, you get a "Create new" completion option for today's daily note if it doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed bug where `:ObsidianOpen` blocked the NeoVim UI on Linux.
- `:ObsidianOpen` should now work on Windows.
- Fixed URL encoding of space characters for better compatibility with external applications.
- Made more robust to unexpected types in frontmatter.

- Fixed handling spaces in configured vault directory.
- Fixed `:ObsidianFollowLink` not considering the vault's root directory.
- Fixed bug where the note ID in the YAML frontmatter wasn't updated after the file is renamed.
- Fixed `require` module name syntax; see #93 for explanation.

### Changed

- The new note completion source will now create the new note in the same directory as the current note, regardless of the `notes_subdir` setting.

### Added

- Added support for arbitrary fields in YAML frontmatter.
- Added configuration option `note_frontmatter_func` for customizing the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This can be set to a function that takes a single argument - an `obsidian.Note` object - and returns a YAML-serializable table.

### Changed
