## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianNew` command for creating a new note with a given title.
- Added setup configuration option `note_id_func`, which can be set to a custom function for generating new note IDs. The function should take a single optional string argument, a title of the note, and return a string. The default method for generating new note IDs is to generate a Zettelkasten-like ID using a timestamp and some random letters.
