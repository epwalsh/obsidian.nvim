 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with respect to the public API, which currently includes the installation steps, dependencies, configuration, keymappings, commands, and other plugin functionality. At the moment this does *not* include the Lua `Client` API, although in the future it will once that API stabilizes.

## [v3.7.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v3.7.0) - 2024-03-08

There's a lot of new features and improvements here that I'm really excited about 🥳 They've improved my workflow a ton and I hope they do for you too. To highlight the 3 biggest additions:
1. 🔗 Full support for header anchor links and block links! That means both for following links and completion of links. Various forms of anchor/block links are support. Here are a few examples:
    - Typical Obsidian-style wiki links, e.g. `[[My note#Heading 1]]`, `[[My note#Heading 1#Sub heading]]`, `[[My note#^block-123]]`.
    - Wiki links with a label, e.g. `[[my-note#heading-1|Heading 1 in My Note]]`.
    - Markdown links, e.g. `[Heading 1 in My Note](my-note.md#heading-1)`.

    We also support links to headers within the same note, like for a table of contents, e.g. `[[#Heading 1]]`, `[[#heading-1|Heading]]`, `[[#^block-1]]`.

2. 📲 A basic callback system to let you easily customize obisidian.nvim's behavior even more. There are currently 4 events: `post_setup`, `enter_note`, `pre_write_note`, and `post_set_workspace`. You can define a function for each of these in your config.
3. 🔭 Improved picker integrations (especially for telescope), particular for the `:ObsidianTags` command. See https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/discussions/450 for a demo.

Full changelog below 👇

### Added

- Added a configurable callback system to further customize obsidian.nvim's behavior. Callbacks are defined through the `callbacks` field in the config:

    ```lua
    callbacks = {
      -- Runs at the end of `require("obsidian").setup()`.
      ---@param client obsidian.Client
      post_setup = function(client) end,

      -- Runs anytime you enter the buffer for a note.
      ---@param client obsidian.Client
      ---@param note obsidian.Note
      enter_note = function(client, note) end,

      -- Runs anytime you leave the buffer for a note.
      ---@param client obsidian.Client
      ---@param note obsidian.Note
      leave_note = function(client, note) end,

      -- Runs right before writing the buffer for a note.
      ---@param client obsidian.Client
      ---@param note obsidian.Note
      pre_write_note = function(client, note) end,

      -- Runs anytime the workspace is set/changed.
      ---@param client obsidian.Client
      ---@param workspace obsidian.Workspace
      post_set_workspace = function(client, workspace) end,
    }
    ```

- Added configuration option `note_path_func(spec): obsidian.Path` for customizing how file names for new notes are generated. This takes a single argument, a table that looks like `{ id: string, dir: obsidian.Path, title: string|? }`, and returns an `obsidian.Path` object. The default behavior is equivalent to this:

    ```lua
    ---@param spec { id: string, dir: obsidian.Path, title: string|? }
    ---@return string|obsidian.Path The full path to the new note.
    note_path_func = function(spec)
      local path = spec.dir / tostring(spec.id)
      return path:with_suffix(".md")
    end
    ```

- Added config option `picker.tag_mappings`, analogous to `picker.note_mappings`.
- Added `log` field to `obsidian.Client` for easier access to the logger.
- Added ability to follow anchor and block links.
- Added completion support for anchor and block links. Note that this requires you to update your `wiki_link_func` and `markdown_link_func` in your config to handle anchors and blocks. See the configuration example in the README.
- You can set `wiki_link_func` to a one of the following strings to use a builtin function:
  - `"use_alias_only"`, e.g. `[[Foo Bar]]`
  - `"prepend_note_id"`, e.g. `[[foo-bar|Foo Bar]]`
  - `"prepend_note_path"`, e.g. `[[foo-bar.md|Foo Bar]]`
  - `"use_path_only"`, e.g. `[[foo-bar.md]]`
- Added command `:ObsidianDailies` for opening a picker list of daily notes.

### Changed

- Renamed config option `picker.mappings` to `picker.note_mappings`.

### Fixed

- Fixed consistency in frontmatter between opening daily notes with or without a template
- Fixed issue with `:ObsidianOpen` on windows.
- Respect telescope.nvim themes configured by user.
- Make tags completion more efficient (less CPU time!).
- Added file/directory completion to image name prompt from `:ObsidianPasteImg`.
- Handle prompt cancellation gracefully.
- Fix lua diagnostic warnings about missing fields in the configuration.
- Made `Client:resolve_note()` more robust to when the search term is a file name.

## [v3.6.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v3.6.1) - 2024-02-28

### Added

- Added configuration option `attachments.confirm_img_paste: boolean` to allow users to control whether they are prompted for confirmation when pasting an image.

### Added

- Added CI testing for Windows.

### Changed

- (internal) Replaced all uses of `plenary.path` with a custom `obsidian.path` class that stays more true to the Python pathlib API and should be more reliable across operating systems.

### Fixed

- If you have `new_notes_location="current_dir"` but you're not inside of a vault, the new note will be created in your vault instead of the current (buffer) directory.
- Fixed a regression where note titles were not considered for autocomplete when the title was not part of the frontmatter (only an H1 header).
- Escaped tags (e.g. `\#notatag`) will no longer come up in tag searches.

## [v3.4.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v3.4.1) - 2024-02-22

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 2024-02-09

⚠️ POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGES! PLEASE READ BELOW ⚠️

### Added

- Added support for "dynamic" workspaces where the workspace `path` field is a function instead of a `string` / `Path`. See [PR #366](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/366).

### Changed

- Changed behavior of workspace detection. When you have multiple workspaces configured, obsidian.nvim will now automatically switch workspaces when you open a buffer in a different workspace. See [PR #366](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/366).
- Various changes to the `Workspace` Lua API. See [PR #366](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/366).
- Changed the behavior of the default frontmatter function so it no longer automatically adds the title of the note as an alias. See the `note_frontmatter_func` example in the README if you want the old behavior.

### Removed

- Removed configuration option `detect_cwd`. This wasn't well-defined before and is no longer relevant with the new workspace detection behavior. See [PR #366](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/366).

### Fixed

- Fixed two bugs with creating new notes through `:ObsidianFollowLink` (and `gf`) where it wouldn't respect the `completion.new_notes_location` settings, and wouldn't respect paths in certain formats.

## [v2.10.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.10.0) - 2024-02-05

### Added

- Added note field `Note.title` to provide more useful info for `note_frontmatter_func`.
- Added client method `Client:format_link()` for creating markdown / wiki links.
- Added telescope action to insert a note link in certain finder scenarios.

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing header with trailing whitespace (https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/issues/341#issuecomment-1925445271).

## [v2.9.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.9.0) - 2024-01-31

### Added

- Added configuration option `image_name_func: (fun(): string)|?` for customizing the default image name/prefix when pasting images via `:ObsidianPasteImg`.
- Added client method `Client:current_note()` to get the note corresponding to the current buffer.
- Added client method `Client:list_tags()` for listing all tags in the vault, along with async version `Client:list_tags_async(callback: fun(tags: string[]))`.
- Added note method `Note.add_field(key: string, value: any)` to add/update an additional field in the frontmatter.
- Added note method `Note.get_field(key: string)`.
- Added note method `Note.save_to_buffer(bufnr: integer|?, frontmatter: table|?)` for saving the frontmatter to a buffer.

### Changed

- `:ObsidianTags` command can take a visual selection or look for a tag under the cursor instead of explicitly provided arguments.

## [v2.8.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.8.0) - 2024-01-26

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianTags` command.

### Changed

- Changed API of client methods `Client:find_tags()` and `Client:find_tags_async()`. The return value (or value passed to the callback) is now a list of objects representing the location of tags found. These objects have the following fields: `tag: string`, `path: string|Path`, `line: integer`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a YAML parsing issue with unquoted URLs in an array item.
- Fixed an issue on Windows when cloning a template into a new note. The root cause was this bug in plenary: https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim/issues/489. We've added a work-around.

## [v2.7.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.7.1) - 2024-01-23

### Fixed

- Fixed powershell command for `:ObsidianPasteImg` in wsl
- Fixed bug with YAML parser that led to incorrectly parsing double-quoted strings with escaped quotes inside.

## [v2.7.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.7.0) - 2024-01-19

### Fixed

- Fixed fzf-lua implementation of insert template and linking.
- Fixed minor bug with `cmp_obsidian_new`.

### Added

- Added support for parsing single aliases specified as a string, not a list, in frontmatter. E.g. `aliases: foo` as opposed to `aliases: [foo]`. Though when the frontmatter is saved it will always be saved as a YAML list, so `aliases: foo` gets saved as `aliases: [foo]` (or equivalent).
- Added `Client` methods `Client:apply_async()` and `Client:apply_async_raw()`.

## [v2.6.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.6.1) - 2024-01-16

### Added

- Added extmarks that conceal "-", "*", or "+" with "•" by default. This can turned off by setting `.ui.bullets` to `nil` in your config.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with resolving the vault-relative path when the vault is behind a symlink.
- Fixed bug with completion after changing workspaces.

## [v2.6.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.6.0) - 2024-01-09

### Changed

- Creating new notes via `:ObsidianFollowLink` now matches the behavior of `:ObsidianLinkNew`, where the new note will be placed in the same directory as the current buffer note. This doesn't affect you if you use a flat directory structure for all of your notes.
- `:ObsidianRename` will prompt for the new title/ID/path if not given as an argument.

### Added

- `:ObsidianFollowLink` now takes an optional "open strategy" argument. For example `:ObsidianFollowLink vsplit` or `:ObsidianFollowLink vsp` opens the note in a vertical split.
- Added client method `Client:command(...)` for running commands directly. For example: `:lua require("obsidian").get_client():command("ObsidianNew", { args = "Foo" })`.
- Added vim docs for the Lua API. See `:help obsidian-api` or `:help obsidian.Client`.
- Added the option to create notes with a mapping from the telescope finder with `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` and `:ObsidianSearch`.
- Added client methods `Client:find_files()` and `Client:find_files_async()` for finding non-markdown files in the vault.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with YAML encoder where strings with a colon followed by whitespace were not quoted.
- Parent directories are created when using a template (for example, for daily notes).
- Fixed bug with finder/picker in `:ObsidianLink` when current working directory is not vault root.
- `:ObsidianFollowLink` will now work when the link contains spaces encoded with "%20" (as they are in URLs) to match the behavior of the Obsidian app.

## [v2.5.3](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.5.3) - 2024-01-02

### Fixed

- Removed some errant print statements.

## [v2.5.2](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.5.2) - 2024-01-02

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Client:resolve_note()` that missed checking the parent directory of the current buffer.
- Made gathering backlinks work with links of different forms, like Markdown or Wiki with just an alias.

## [v2.5.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.5.1) - 2024-01-01

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug on Linux where we call a restricted function in an async context.
- Fixed bug with resolving relative path in vault when path is already relative.

## [v2.5.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.5.0) - 2023-12-30

### Added

- Added Lua API methods `Client:set_workspace(workspace: obsidian.Workspace)` and `Client:switch_workspace(workspace: string|obsidian.Workspace)`.
- Added the ability to override settings per workspace by providing the `overrides` field in a workspace definition. For example:

    ```lua
    require("obsidian").setup({
      workspaces = {
        {
          name = "personal",
          path = "~/vaults/personal",
        },
        {
          name = "work",
          path = "~/vaults/work",
          -- Optional, override certain settings.
          overrides = {
            notes_subdir = "notes",
          },
        },
      },

      -- ... other options ...
    })
    ```

### Fixed

- Made workspace API more robust.
- Template substitutions are done lazily and only generated once per line.
- Fixed search functionality with `fzf.vim` as a finder when the vault name contains characters that need to be escaped, such as spaces.
- Fixed a bug with ext marks for references inside of frontmatter.

## [v2.4.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.4.0) - 2023-12-19

### Changed

- Replaced `Client.templates_dir` field with `Client:templates_dir()` function.
- `:ObsidianLink` will now open your finder when the initial search comes up empty or ambiguous.
- Improve logging when `client:vault_relative_path()` fails in `cmp_obsidian_new`.

## [v2.3.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.3.1) - 2023-12-03

### Added

- Added `Client:update_ui()` method.
- Assigned enum type `obsidian.config.OpenStrategy` to `config.open_notes_in`.
- `disable_frontmatter` now can be a function taking the filename of a note (relative to the vault root) to determine whether the note's frontmatter can be managed by obsidian.nvim or not.

### Changed

- `Client:daily_note_path()` now takes a datetime integer instead of an ID string.
- Template substitutions can now handle multiple lines, i.e. you can define custom substitutions that return a string with new line characters.
- The "vsplit" and "hsplit" open strategies for `config.open_notes_in` will now only open a vertical/horizontal split if the window is not already split.

- Added `:ObsidianPasteImg` for pasting images from the clipboard into notes. See the `attachments` configuration option for customizing the behavior of this command. Inspired by [md-img-paste.vim](https://github.com/ferrine/md-img-paste.vim) and [clipboard-image.nvim](https://github.com/ekickx/clipboard-image.nvim).
- Added `completion.prepend_note_path` and `completion.use_path_only` options (mutually exclusive with each other and `completion.prepend_note_id`).
- Added support for completing traditional markdown links instead of just wiki links.

### Changed

- Renamed `opts.ui.tick` to `opts.ui.update_debounce`, but the `tick` field will still be read for backwards compatibility.
- `:ObsidianOpen` will now open wiki links under the cursor instead of always opening the note of the current buffer.
- `:ObsidianBacklinks` will now show backlinks for the note of a wiki link under the cursor instead of always showing backlinks for the note of the current buffer.

### Fixed

- Ensure commands available across all buffers, not just note buffers in the vault.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2023-11-16

**Highlights:**

The long awaited `:ObsidianRename` command is here along with big improvements to our syntax add-ons! Wiki links, external links, and checklists look much better now out-of-the-box and can be easily customized! 🥳

I recommend you use treesitter as a base markdown syntax highlighter, but obsidian.nvim is also compatible with traditional regex syntax highlighting.

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianRename` command.
- Added `:ObsidianTomorrow` command.
- Added optional offset to `:ObsidianToday` command. For example: `:ObsidianToday -1` to go to yesterday's daily note.
- Added configuration option `ui` for customizing obsidian.nvim's additional syntax highlighting and extmarks.
- Improved default additional syntax highlighting / concealing.
- Added default mapping `<leader>ch` for toggling check-boxes.

### Fixed

- Ensure additional syntax highlighting works with latest treesitter.

## [v1.16.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.16.1) - 2023-11-11

### Changed

## [v1.16.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.16.0) - 2023-11-10

Major internal refactoring to bring performance improvements through async execution of search/find functionality, and general robustness improvements. 🏎️🤠

### Added

- Added `obsidian.async` module for internal use.

### Changed

- Re-implemented the native Lua YAML parser (`obsidian.yaml.native`). This should be faster and more robust now.
- Re-implemented search/find functionality to utilize concurrency via `obsidian.async` and `plenary.async` for big performance gains.
- Made how run shell commands more robust, and we also log stderr lines now.
- Submodules imported lazily.
- Changes to internal module organization.

### Fixed

- Fixed a completion bug (#212).
- Fixed a bug where the frontmatter of daily note template would be overwritten upon inserting the template.
- Skip templates directory when searching for notes.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with the latest `fzf.vim` and made running finders more robust in general.

### Removed

- Removed the `overwrite_mappings` option.

## [v1.15.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.15.0) - 2023-10-20

### Added

- The `overwrite_mappings` option, which sets the mappings in the config even if they already exist
- Added support for multiple vaults (#128)
- Added command to switch between vaults (#60)
- Added configuration option `yaml_parser` (a string value of either "native" or "yq") to change the YAML parser.

### Fixed

- Eliminated silent runtime errors on validation errors in `note.from_lines`.
- Fixed parsing YAML boolean values in frontmatter.

## [v1.14.2](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.2) - 2023-09-25

### Fixed

- Updated recommendation for how to configure mappings.

## [v1.14.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.1) - 2023-09-22

### Fixed

- Added back missing `util.find()` function.

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.14.0) - 2023-09-22

### Added

- Added config option `sort_by` to allow setting search result order by "path", "modified", "accessed", or "created".
- Added config option `sort_reversed` to allow setting search result sort reversed order. The default is `true`.
- Added an extra option for daily notes to allow changing the default title from "%B %-d, %Y" to other strings.
- Added a configuration option `daily_notes.template` for automatically using a specific template when creating a new daily note.
- Adding a configuration option `templates.substitutions` for defining custom template substitutions.

### Changed

- Minor change to the behavior of `:ObsidianNew`. The argument to this command can be in one of 3 different forms which determine the behavior of the command:
  1. A raw title without any path components, e.g. `:ObsidianNew Foo`. In this case the command will pass the title to the `note_id_func` and put the note in the default location.
  2. A title prefixed by a path component, e.g. `:ObsidianNew notes/Foo`. In this case the command will pass the title "Foo" to the `note_id_func` and put the note in the directory of the path prefix "notes/".
  3. An exact path, e.g. `:ObsidianNew notes/foo.md`. In this case the command will put the new note at the path given and the title will be inferred from the filename ("foo").

### Fixed

- A bug when following links when headers have a space.
- Fixed `ObsidianFollowLink` when the note path contains a block link (e.g. `[[foo#^Bar]]`).
- Fixed `:ObsidianOpen` doesn't work in WSL2
  - Use [wsl-open](https://gitlab.com/4U6U57/wsl-open)
- Improved completion start pattern to trigger anytime `[[` is typed.
- Fixed issue with parsing inline lists in YAML frontmatter when the items aren't wrapped in quotes.

### Added

- Added option `prepend_note_id` to allow disabling id generation for new notes.
- Added `mappings` configuration field.
- Added `open_notes_in` configuration field
- Added `backlinks` options to the config. The default is
  ```lua

    -- The default height of the backlinks pane.
    height = 10,
    -- Whether or not to wrap lines.
    wrap = true,
  },
  ```

### Changed

- (internal) Refactored daily note creation.
- obsidian.nvim will now automatically enable the 'gf' passthrough keybinding within your vault unless the 'gf' keybinding has already been overridden by you or another plugin or you override the 'mappings' configuration field.

### Fixed

- Fixed new notes not getting passed args correctly

- Fixed `ObsidianFollowLink` when the note path contains a header link (e.g. `[[foo#Bar]]`).

## [v1.11.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.11.0) - 2023-06-09

- Added `finder` option for choosing a preferred finder backend.

### Fixed

- Removed annoying "skipped updating frontmatter" message on file write.

- Fixed `nvim-cmp` completion for notes that have no `aliases` specified.
- `nvim-cmp` completion will search based on file names now too, not just contents.
- Fixed bug when `nvim-cmp` is not installed.
- Workaround error which prevented users from using `ObsidianOpen` when vault path was configured behind a link
- Detect URLs when following links and ignore them by default.

## [v1.8.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.8.0) - 2023-02-16

### Changed

- [`lua-yaml`](https://github.com/exosite/lua-yaml) no-longer bundled as a git submodule. Code from that project has been copied and modified into it's own Lua submodule of `obsidian`.
- (BREAKING) 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' is no-longer bundled, so must be explicitly installed (e.g. Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' in your `init.nvim`).

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where creating a new note with `nvim-cmp` completion
  would cause `nvim-cmp` to stop working.
- Fixed bug where `disable_frontmatter` setting would be ignored for `:ObsidianNew` command.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Note.from_lines` where the given path would be modified in place to be relative to the root, which caused a bug in `:ObsidianFollowLink`.
- Completion for creating new notes via nvim-cmp is now aware of daily notes, so when you start typing todays date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD, you get a "Create new" completion option for today's daily note if it doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed bug where `:ObsidianOpen` blocked the NeoVim UI on Linux.
- `:ObsidianOpen` should now work on Windows.

### Added

- Added support for arbitrary fields in YAML frontmatter.
