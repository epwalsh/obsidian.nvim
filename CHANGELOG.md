## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianFollowLink` and companion function `util.cursor_on_markdown_link`
- Added `:ObsidianLink` and `:ObsidianLinkNew` commands.
- Added configuration option `disable_frontmatter` for frontmatter disabling

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Note.from_lines` where the given path would be modified in place to be relative to the root, which caused a bug in `:ObsidianFollowLink`.
- Completion for creating new notes via nvim-cmp is now aware of daily notes, so when you start typing todays date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD, you get a "Create new" completion option for today's daily note if it doesn't exist yet.

## [v1.6.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.6.1) - 2022-10-17

### Fixed

- Ensured vault directory along with optional notes and daily notes subdirectories are added to vim's `path` so you can `gf` to files in those directories.

## [v1.6.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.6.0) - 2022-10-14

### Added

- Added support for arbitrary fields in YAML frontmatter.
- Added configuration option `note_frontmatter_func` for customizing the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This can be set to a function that takes a single argument - an `obsidian.Note` object - and returns a YAML-serializable table.

### Changed

- Added folding and custom highlighting to backlinks window, and fixed window height.
- When the title of a note is changed, the title will automatically be added to note's aliases in the frontmatter on save.

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete functionality to be less sensitive to case.
- Made YAML frontmatter dumping functionality more robust.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.5.0) - 2022-10-12

### Changed

- Improved `:ObsidianBacklinks` command to use its own buffer type instead of the location list.
  It's now more readable.
- Removed save on write for `:ObsidianNew` and `:ObsidianToday` ([#32](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/pull/32)).

### Fixed

- `:ObsidianOpen` now works on Linux.

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.4.0) - 2022-10-11

### Added

- Added `daily_notes` configuration options.
- Added `:ObsidianSearch` command (requires `fzf.vim` or `telescope.nvim`).

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with `:ObsidianOpen` ([#19](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/issues/19)).
- Fixed bug with creating a new note with `nvim-cmp` completion where full settings
  weren't taken into account.
- Fixed a bug with `:ObsidianBacklinks` where the paths were incorrect.

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.3.0) - 2022-09-23

### Changed

- `plenary.nvim` is no longer required to be installed seperately. It's now bundled as a submodule.

## [v1.2.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2022-09-23

### Added

- Added setup configuration option `notes_subdir`. Use this if you want new notes to be put in a specific subdirectory of your vault.

### Changed

- Commands are no-longer setup lazily on `BufEnter` to a markdown file in your vault. Now they'll always be available.

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2022-09-22

### Added

- Added `:ObsidianNew` command for creating a new note with a given title.
- Added setup configuration option `note_id_func`, which can be set to a custom function for generating new note IDs. The function should take a single optional string argument, a title of the note, and return a string. The default method for generating new note IDs is to generate a Zettelkasten-like ID using a timestamp and some random letters.

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases/tag/v1.1.1) - 2022-08-22

### Fixed

- Fixed bug when creating new notes. Sometimes this would fail if `~/` wasn't expanded.
