1. Obsidian.nvim                                      *obsidian-obsidian.nvim*

A Neovim plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian <https://obsidian.md>
vault, written in Lua.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian – a simple, markdown-based
notes app – but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

_This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it._ My
personal workflow involves writing Obsidian notes in Neovim using this plugin,
while viewing and reading them using the Obsidian app. That said, this plugin
stands on its own as well. You don’t necessarily need to use it alongside the
Obsidian app.


FEATURES                                     *obsidian-obsidian.nvim-features*


- ▶️ Autocompletion for note references via nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp> (triggered by typing `[[`)
- 🏃 Go to a note buffer with `gf` when cursor is on a reference
- 💅 Additional markdown syntax highlighting and concealing for references


COMMANDS ~


- `:ObsidianBacklinks` for getting a location list of references to the current buffer.
- `:ObsidianToday` to create a new daily note.
- `:ObsidianYesterday` to open (eventually creating) the daily note for the previous working day.
- `:ObsidianOpen` to open a note in the Obsidian app.
    This command has one optional argument: the ID, path, or alias of the note to open. If not given, the note corresponding to the current buffer is opened.
- `:ObsidianNew` to create a new note.
    This command has one optional argument: the title of the new note.
- `:ObsidianSearch` to search for notes in your vault using ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> with fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>, fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua> or telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.
    This command has one optional argument: a search query to start with.
- `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to quickly switch to another notes in your vault, searching by its name using fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>, fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua> or telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.
- `:ObsidianLink` to link an in-line visual selection of text to a note.
    This command has one optional argument: the ID, path, or alias of the note to link to. If not given, the selected text will be used to find the note with a matching ID, path, or alias.
- `:ObsidianLinkNew` to create a new note and link it to an in-line visual selection of text.
    This command has one optional argument: the title of the new note. If not given, the selected text will be used as the title.
- `:ObsidianFollowLink` to follow a note reference under the cursor.
- `:ObsidianTemplate` to insert a template from the templates folder, selecting from a list using telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or one of the `fzf` alternatives.

SETUP                                           *obsidian-obsidian.nvim-setup*


REQUIREMENTS ~


- NeoVim >= 0.8.0 (this plugin uses `vim.fs` which was only added in 0.8).
- If you want completion and search features (recommended) you’ll also need ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> to be installed and on your `$PATH`.
    See ripgrep#installation <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> for install options.

Search functionality (e.g. via the `:ObsidianSearch` and
`:ObsidianQuickSwitch` commands) also requires telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or one of the `fzf`
alternatives (see below).


INSTALL AND CONFIGURE ~

Using `lazy.nvim` <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>, for example:

**❗ Notes**


- Obsidian.nvim will set itself up as an nvim-cmp source automatically when you enter a markdown buffer within your vault directory, you do **not** need to specify this plugin as a cmp source manually.
- If you use `vim-markdown` you’ll probably want to disable its frontmatter syntax highlighting (`vim.g.vim_markdown_frontmatter = 1`) which I’ve found doesn’t work very well.
- The `notes_subdir` and `note_id_func` options are not mutually exclusive. You can use them both. For example, using a combination of both of the above settings, a new note called "My new note" will assigned a path like `notes/1657296016-my-new-note.md`.


TEMPLATES SUPPORT ~

To insert a template, run the command `:ObsidianTemplate`. This will open
telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or one of the
`fzf` alternatives and allow you to select a template from the templates
folder. Select a template and hit `<CR>` to insert. Substitution of `{{date}}`,
`{{time}}`, and `{{title}}` is supported.

For example, with the following configuration

>lua
    {
      -- other fields ...
    
      templates = {
          subdir = "my-templates-folder",
          date_format = "%Y-%m-%d-%a",
          time_format = "%H:%M"
      },
    }
<

and the file `~/my-vault/my-templates-folder/note template.md`:

>markdown
    # {{title}}
    Date created: {{date}}
<

creating the note `Configuring Neovim.md` and executing `:ObsidianTemplate`
will insert

>markdown
    # Configuring Neovim
    
    Date created: 2023-03-01-Wed
<

above the cursor position.


USING NVIM-TREESITTER ~

If you’re using nvim-treesitter
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/README.md> and
not vim-markdown <https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown>, you’ll probably
want to enable `additional_vim_regex_highlighting` for markdown to benefit from
Obsidian.nvim’s extra syntax improvements:

>lua
    require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
      ensure_installed = { "markdown", "markdown_inline", ... },
      highlight = {
        enable = true,
        additional_vim_regex_highlighting = { "markdown" },
      },
    })

KNOWN ISSUES                             *obsidian-obsidian.nvim-known-issues*


CONFIGURING VAULT DIRECTORY BEHIND A LINK ~

If you are having issues with commands like `ObsidianOpen`, ensure that your
vault is configured to use an absolute path rather than a link. If you must use
a link in your configuration, make sure that the name of the vault is present
in the file path of the link. For example:

>
    Vault: ~/path/to/vault/parent/obsidian/
    Link: ~/obsidian OR ~/parent
