1. Obsidian.nvim                                      *obsidian-obsidian.nvim*

A Neovim plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian <https://obsidian.md>
vault, written in Lua.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian – a simple, markdown-based
notes app – but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

_This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it._ My
personal workflow involves writing Obsidian notes in Neovim using this plugin,
while viewing and reading them using the Obsidian app. That said, this plugin
stands on its own as well. You don’t necessarily need to use it alongside the
Obsidian app.

FEATURES                                                   *obsidian-features*


- ▶️ Autocompletion for note references via nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp> (triggered by typing `[[`)
- 🏃 Go to a note buffer with `gf` when cursor is on a reference (see: |obsidian-mapping-`:obsidianfollowlink`-to-`gf`-with-follow-through| for an even better `gf`)
- 💅 Additional markdown syntax highlighting and concealing for references


COMMANDS ~


- `:ObsidianBacklinks` for getting a location list of references to the current buffer.
- `:ObsidianToday` to create a new daily note.
- `:ObsidianYesterday` to open (eventually creating) the daily note for the previous working day.
- `:ObsidianOpen` to open a note in the Obsidian app.
    This command has one optional argument: the ID, path, or alias of the note to open. If not given, the note corresponding to the current buffer is opened.
- `:ObsidianNew` to create a new note.
    This command has one optional argument: the title of the new note.
- `:ObsidianSearch` to search for notes in your vault using ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> with fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim> or telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.
    This command has one optional argument: a search query to start with.
- `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to quickly switch to another notes in your vault, searching by its name using fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim> or telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.
- `:ObsidianLink` to link an in-line visual selection of text to a note.
    This command has one optional argument: the ID, path, or alias of the note to link to. If not given, the selected text will be used to find the note with a matching ID, path, or alias.
- `:ObsidianLinkNew` to create a new note and link it to an in-line visual selection of text.
    This command has one optional argument: the title of the new note. If not given, the selected text will be used as the title.
- `:ObsidianFollowLink` to follow a note reference under the cursor.


SETUP                                                         *obsidian-setup*

REQUIREMENTS ~


- NeoVim >= 0.8.0 (this plugin uses `vim.fs` which was only added in 0.8).
- If you want completion and search features (recommended) you’ll also need ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> to be installed and on your `$PATH`.
    See ripgrep#installation <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> for install options.


Search functionality via the `:ObsidianSearch` and `:ObsidianQuickSwitch`
command also requires either fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim> or
telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.

INSTALL ~

Using `vim-plug`, for example:

>
    " (optional) for completion:
    Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'
    
    " (optional) for :ObsidianSearch and :ObsidianQuickSwitch commands unless you use telescope:
    Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
    Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
    
    " (optional) another alternative for the :ObsidianSearch and :ObsidianQuickSwitch commands:
    Plug 'ibhagwan/fzf-lua'
    
    " (optional) for :ObsidianSearch and :ObsidianQuickSwitch commands if you prefer this over fzf.vim:
    Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
    
    " (optional) recommended for syntax highlighting, folding, etc if you're not using nvim-treesitter:
    Plug 'preservim/vim-markdown'
    Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'  " needed by 'preservim/vim-markdown'
    
    " (required)
    Plug 'epwalsh/obsidian.nvim'
<


To avoid unexpected breaking changes, you can also pin `Obsidian.nvim` to a
specific release like this:

>
    Plug 'epwalsh/obsidian.nvim', { 'tag': 'v1.*' }
<


Always check the CHANGELOG <./CHANGELOG.md> when upgrading.

MINIMAL CONFIGURATION ~

For a minimal configuration, just add:

>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      completion = {
        nvim_cmp = true, -- if using nvim-cmp, otherwise set to false
      }
    })
<


❗ Note: you do **not** need to specify this plugin as an `nvim-cmp` "source".
Obsidian.nvim will set itself up as a source automatically when you enter a
markdown buffer within your vault directory.

>
    require("cmp").setup({
      sources = {
        { name = "obsidian" }, -- WRONG! Don't put this here. Obsidian configures itself for nvim-cmp
      },
    })
<


ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ~

                                     *obsidian-Customizing-note-paths-and-IDs*

Customizing note paths and IDs         If you want to customize how the file
                                       names / unique IDs for new notes are
                                       created, set the configuration option
                                       `note_id_func` to your own function that
                                       takes an optional string (the title of
                                       the note) as input and returns a string
                                       representing a unique ID or file name /
                                       path (relative to your vault directory).


For example:

>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      note_id_func = function(title)
        -- Create note IDs in a Zettelkasten format with a timestamp and a suffix.
        local suffix = ""
        if title ~= nil then
          -- If title is given, transform it into valid file name.
          suffix = title:gsub(" ", "-"):gsub("[^A-Za-z0-9-]", ""):lower()
        else
          -- If title is nil, just add 4 random uppercase letters to the suffix.
          for _ = 1, 4 do
            suffix = suffix .. string.char(math.random(65, 90))
          end
        end
        return tostring(os.time()) .. "-" .. suffix
      end
    })
<


In this case a note with the title "My new note" will given an ID that looks
something like `1657296016-my-new-note`, and therefore the file name
`1657296016-my-new-note.md`. If you always want to put new notes in a
particular subdirectory of your vault, use the option `notes_subdir`:

>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      notes_subdir = "notes",
    })
<


The `notes_subdir` and `note_id_func` options are not mutually exclusive. You
can use them both. For example, using a combination of both of the above
settings, a new note called "My new note" will assigned a path like
`notes/1657296016-my-new-note.md`.

                                       *obsidian-Customizing-daily-notes-path*

Customizing daily notes path           If you want to customize where the daily
                                       notes are being stored, just set the
                                       `daily_notes.folder` option:


>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      daily_notes = {
        folder = "dailies",
      }
    })
<


This option isn’t mutually exclusive with the `notes_subdir` function; the
`daily_notes.folder` path won’t be appended to `notes_subdir`, so both paths
will need to be relative to `dir`.

E.g., if you have your vault at `~/my-vault`, and want to save your notes under
`~/my-vault/notes`, and your dailies under `~/my-vault/notes/dailies`, this is
the right config:

>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      notes_subdir = "notes",
      daily_notes = {
        folder = "notes/dailies",
      }
    })
<


                                              *obsidian-Using-nvim-treesitter*

Using nvim-treesitter                  If you’re using nvim-treesitter
                                       <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/README.md>
                                       and not vim-markdown
                                       <https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown>,
                                       you’ll probably want to enable
                                       `additional_vim_regex_highlighting` for
                                       markdown to benefit from
                                       Obsidian.nvim’s extra syntax
                                       improvements:


>
    require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
      ensure_installed = { "markdown", "markdown_inline", ... },
      highlight = {
        enable = true,
        additional_vim_regex_highlighting = { "markdown" },
      },
    })
<


           *obsidian-Customizing-the-automatically-generated-YAML-frontmatter*

Customizing the automatically generated YAML frontmatter By default the
                                       auto-generated YAML frontmatter will
                                       just contain `id`, `aliases`, and
                                       `tags`, as well as any other fields you
                                       add manually. If you want to customize
                                       this behavior, set the configuration
                                       option `note_frontmatter_func` to a
                                       function that takes an `obsidian.Note`
                                       object and returns a table. Or if you
                                       want to disable this feature, just set
                                       `disable_frontmatter = true`.


For example, you can emulate the default functionality like this:

>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      note_frontmatter_func = function(note)
        local out = { id = note.id, aliases = note.aliases, tags = note.tags }
        -- `note.metadata` contains any manually added fields in the frontmatter.
        -- So here we just make sure those fields are kept in the frontmatter.
        if note.metadata ~= nil and require("obsidian").util.table_length(note.metadata) > 0 then
          for k, v in pairs(note.metadata) do
            out[k] = v
          end
        end
        return out
      end,
    })
<


             *obsidian-Mapping-`:ObsidianFollowLink`-to-`gf`-with-passthrough*

Mapping `:ObsidianFollowLink` to `gf` with passthrough If you have notes in
                                       subdirectories of your vault, Neovim’s
                                       default `gf` mapping might not be able
                                       to find the note corresponding to the
                                       reference under your cursor. If that’s
                                       the case you can map `gf` to the
                                       `:ObsidianFollowLink` command like this:


>
    vim.keymap.set(
      "n",
      "gf",
      function()
        if require('obsidian').util.cursor_on_markdown_link() then
          return "<cmd>ObsidianFollowLink<CR>"
        else
          return "gf"
        end
      end,
      { noremap = false, expr = true}
    )
<


The other benefit of doing this is that it will now work even if your cursor is
on the enclosing brackets (`[[` or `]]`) or the alias part of a reference (the
part after `|`).

            *obsidian-Navigate-to-the-current-line-when-using-`:ObsidianOpen`*

Navigate to the current line when using `:ObsidianOpen` If you have the
                                       Obsidian Advanced URI
                                       <https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri>
                                       plugin enabled, the Obsidian editor can
                                       automatically navigate to the same line
                                       in the current NeoVim buffer. For files
                                       that are already open, it will update
                                       the cursor position within Obsidian’s
                                       editor. To enable this feature, add
                                       `use_advanced_uri = true` to the setup
                                       options. For example:


>
    require("obsidian").setup({
      dir = "~/my-vault",
      use_advanced_uri = true
    })
