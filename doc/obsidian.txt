*obsidian.nvim*           a plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian vault

obsidian.nvim

A Neovim plugin for writing and navigating Obsidian <https://obsidian.md>
vaults, written in Lua.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian – a simple, markdown-based
notes app – but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

If you’re new to Obsidian I highly recommend watching this excellent YouTube
video <https://youtu.be/5ht8NYkU9wQ?si=8nbnNsRVnw0xfX2S> for a great overview.

_Keep in mind this plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement
it._ The Obsidian app is very powerful in its own way; it comes with a mobile
app and has a lot of functionality that’s not feasible to implement in
Neovim, such as the graph explorer view. That said, this plugin stands on its
own as well. You don’t necessarily need to use it alongside the Obsidian app.

2. Features                                                *obsidian-features*

▶️ **Completion:** Ultra-fast, asynchronous autocompletion for note
references and tags via nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp>
(triggered by typing `[[` for wiki links, `[` for markdown links, or `#` for
tags), powered by `ripgrep` <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>.


<https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/assets/8812459/90d5f218-06cd-4ebb-b00b-b59c2f5c3cc1>

🏃 **Navigation:** Navigate throughout your vault by typing `gf` on any link
to another note.

📷 **Images:** Paste images into notes.

💅 **Syntax:** Additional markdown syntax highlighting, concealing, and
extmarks for references, tags, and check-boxes.

COMMANDS                                                   *obsidian-commands*

- `:ObsidianOpen [QUERY]` to open a note in the Obsidian app. This command has
    one optional argument: a query used to resolve the note to open by ID, path, or
    alias. If not given, the note corresponding to the current buffer is opened.
- `:ObsidianNew [TITLE]` to create a new note. This command has one optional
    argument: the title of the new note.
- `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to quickly switch to (or open) another note in your
    vault, searching by its name using ripgrep
    <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> with your preferred picker (see
    |obsidian-plugin-dependencies| below).
- `:ObsidianFollowLink [vsplit|hsplit]` to follow a note reference under the
    cursor, optionally opening it in a vertical or horizontal split.
- `:ObsidianBacklinks` for getting a picker list of references to the current
    buffer.
- `:ObsidianTags [TAG ...]` for getting a picker list of all occurrences of the
    given tags.
- `:ObsidianToday [OFFSET]` to open/create a new daily note. This command also
    takes an optional offset in days, e.g. use `:ObsidianToday -1` to go to
    yesterday’s note. Unlike `:ObsidianYesterday` and `:ObsidianTomorrow` this
    command does not differentiate between weekdays and weekends.
- `:ObsidianYesterday` to open/create the daily note for the previous working
    day.
- `:ObsidianTomorrow` to open/create the daily note for the next working day.
- `:ObsidianDailies [OFFSET ...]` to open a picker list of daily notes. For
    example, `:ObsidianDailies -2 1` to list daily notes from 2 days ago until
    tomorrow.
- `:ObsidianTemplate [NAME]` to insert a template from the templates folder,
    selecting from a list using your preferred picker. See
    |obsidian-"using-templates"| for more information.
- `:ObsidianSearch [QUERY]` to search for (or create) notes in your vault using
    `ripgrep` with your preferred picker.
- `:ObsidianLink [QUERY]` to link an inline visual selection of text to a note.
    This command has one optional argument: a query that will be used to resolve
    the note by ID, path, or alias. If not given, the selected text will be used as
    the query.
- `:ObsidianLinkNew [TITLE]` to create a new note and link it to an inline visual
    selection of text. This command has one optional argument: the title of the new
    note. If not given, the selected text will be used as the title.
- `:ObsidianLinks` to collect all links within the current buffer into a picker
    window.
- `:ObsidianExtractNote [TITLE]` to extract the visually selected text into a new
    note and link to it.
- `:ObsidianWorkspace [NAME]` to switch to another workspace.
- `:ObsidianPasteImg [IMGNAME]` to paste an image from the clipboard into the
    note at the cursor position by saving it to the vault and adding a markdown
    image link. You can configure the default folder to save images to with the
    `attachments.img_folder` option.
- `:ObsidianRename [NEWNAME] [--dry-run]` to rename the note of the current
    buffer or reference under the cursor, updating all backlinks across the vault.
    Since this command is still relatively new and could potentially write a lot of
    changes to your vault, I highly recommend committing the current state of your
    vault (if you’re using version control) before running it, or doing a dry-run
    first by appending "–dry-run" to the command, e.g. `:ObsidianRename new-id
    --dry-run`.
- `:ObsidianToggleCheckbox` to cycle through checkbox options.

3. Setup                                                      *obsidian-setup*


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS                             *obsidian-system-requirements*

- NeoVim >= 0.8.0 (this plugin uses `vim.fs` which was only added in 0.8).
- If you want completion and search features (recommended) you’ll need ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> to be installed and on your `$PATH`.
    See ripgrep#installation <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> for install options.

Specific operating systems also require additional dependencies in order to use
all of obsidian.nvim’s functionality:

- **Windows WSL** users need `wsl-open` <https://gitlab.com/4U6U57/wsl-open> for the `:ObsidianOpen` command.
- **MacOS** users need `pngpaste` <https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste> (`brew install pngpaste`) for the `:ObsidianPasteImg` command.
- **Linux** users need xclip (X11) or wl-clipboard (Wayland) for the `:ObsidianPasteImg` command.

Search functionality (e.g. via the `:ObsidianSearch` and
`:ObsidianQuickSwitch` commands) also requires a picker such telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> (see
|obsidian-plugin-dependencies| below).


INSTALL AND CONFIGURE                         *obsidian-install-and-configure*

To configure obsidian.nvim you just need to call `require("obsidian").setup({
... })` with the desired options. Here are some examples using different plugin
managers. The full set of |obsidian-plugin-dependencies| and
|obsidian-configuration-options| are listed below.


  ⚠️ WARNING: if you install from the latest release (recommended for
  stability) instead of `main`, be aware that the README on `main` may reference
  features that haven’t been released yet. For that reason I recommend viewing
  the README on the tag for the latest release
  <https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/releases> instead of `main`.

PLUGIN DEPENDENCIES                             *obsidian-plugin-dependencies*

The only **required** plugin dependency is plenary.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim>, but there are a number of optional
dependencies that enhance the obsidian.nvim experience.

**Completion:**

- **[recommended]** hrsh7th/nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp>: for completion of note references.

**Pickers:**

- **[recommended]** nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>: for search and quick-switch functionality.
- Mini.Pick <https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.pick> from the mini.nvim library: an alternative to telescope for search and quick-switch functionality.
- ibhagwan/fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>: another alternative to telescope for search and quick-switch functionality.

**Syntax highlighting:**

- **[recommended]** nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>: for base markdown syntax highlighting. See |obsidian-syntax-highlighting| for more details.

defaults, but represent reasonable default settings_. Please read each option
carefully and customize it to your needs:

>lua
    {
      -- A list of workspace names, paths, and configuration overrides.
      -- If you use the Obsidian app, the 'path' of a workspace should generally be
      -- your vault root (where the `.obsidian` folder is located).
      -- When obsidian.nvim is loaded by your plugin manager, it will automatically set
      -- the workspace to the first workspace in the list whose `path` is a parent of the
      -- current markdown file being edited.

NOTES ON CONFIGURATION                       *obsidian-notes-on-configuration*


WORKSPACES ~

For most Obsidian users, each workspace you configure in your obsidian.nvim
config should correspond to a unique Obsidian vault, in which case the `path`
of each workspace should be set to the corresponding vault root path.

For example, suppose you have an Obsidian vault at `~/vaults/personal`, then
the `workspaces` field in your config would look like this:

>lua
    config = {
      workspaces = {
        {
          name = "personal",
          path = "~/vaults/personal",
        },
      }
    }
<

However obsidian.nvim’s concept of workspaces is a little more general than
that of vaults, since it’s also valid to configure a workspace that doesn’t
correspond to a vault, or to configure multiple workspaces for a single vault.
The latter case can be useful if you want to segment a single vault into
multiple directories with different settings applied to each directory. For
example:

>lua
    config = {
      workspaces = {
        {
          name = "project-1",
          path = "~/vaults/personal/project-1",
          -- `strict=true` here tells obsidian to use the `path` as the workspace/vault root,
          -- even though the actual Obsidian vault root may be `~/vaults/personal/`.
          strict = true,
          overrides = {
            -- ...
          },
        },
        {
          name = "project-2",
          path = "~/vaults/personal/project-2",
          strict = true,
          overrides = {
            -- ...
          },
        },
      }
    }
<

obsidian.nvim also supports "dynamic" workspaces. These are simply workspaces
where the `path` is set to a Lua function (that returns a path) instead of a
hard-coded path. This can be useful in several scenarios, such as when you want
a workspace whose `path` is always set to the parent directory of the current
buffer:

>lua
    config = {
      workspaces = {
        {
          name = "buf-parent",
          path = function()
            return assert(vim.fs.dirname(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0)))
          end,
        },
      }
    }
<

Dynamic workspaces are also useful when you want to use a subset of this
plugin’s functionality on markdown files outside of your "fixed" vaults. See
|obsidian-using-obsidian.nvim-outside-of-a-workspace-/-obsidian-vault|.


COMPLETION ~

obsidian.nvim will set itself up as an nvim-cmp source automatically when you
enter a markdown buffer within your vault directory, you do **not** need to
specify this plugin as a cmp source manually.

Note that in order to trigger completion for tags _within YAML frontmatter_ you
still need to type the "#" at the start of the tag. obsidian.nvim will remove
the "#" when you hit enter on the tag completion item.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING ~

If you’re using nvim-treesitter
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/README.md>
you’re configuration should include both "markdown" and "markdown_inline"
sources:

>lua
    require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
      ensure_installed = { "markdown", "markdown_inline", ... },
      highlight = {
        enable = true,
      },
    })
<

If you use `vim-markdown` you’ll probably want to disable its frontmatter
syntax highlighting (`vim.g.vim_markdown_frontmatter = 1`) which I’ve found
doesn’t work very well.


CONCEALING CHARACTERS ~

If you wish to use the formatting concealment features, you will need to have
`conceallevel` set to a value that allows it (either `1` or `2`), for example:
`set conceallevel=1` in viml or `vim.opt.conceallevel = 1` in a lua config.


NOTE NAMING AND LOCATION ~

The `notes_subdir` and `note_id_func` options are not mutually exclusive. You
can use them both. For example, using a combination of both of the above
settings, a new note called "My new note" will assigned a path like
`notes/1657296016-my-new-note.md`.


GF PASSTHROUGH ~

If you want the `gf` passthrough functionality but you’ve already overridden
the `gf` keybinding, just change your `gf` mapping definition to something like
this:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gf", function()
      if require("obsidian").util.cursor_on_markdown_link() then
        return "<cmd>ObsidianFollowLink<CR>"
      else
        return "gf"
      end
    end, { noremap = false, expr = true })
<

Then make sure to comment out the `gf` keybinding in your obsidian.nvim config:

>lua
    mappings = {
      -- ["gf"] = ...
    },
<

Or alternatively you could map obsidian.nvim’s follow functionality to a
different key:

>lua
    mappings = {
      ["fo"] = {
        action = function()
          return require("obsidian").util.gf_passthrough()
        end,
        opts = { noremap = false, expr = true, buffer = true },
      },
    },
<


USING TEMPLATES                                     *obsidian-using-templates*

To insert a template, run the command `:ObsidianTemplate`. This will open a
list of available templates in your templates folder with your preferred
picker. Select a template and hit `<CR>` to insert. Substitutions for `{{id}}`,
`{{title}}`, `{{path}}`, `{{date}}`, and `{{time}}` are supported
out-of-the-box.

For example, with the following configuration

>lua
    {
      -- other fields ...
    
      templates = {
          folder = "my-templates-folder",
          date_format = "%Y-%m-%d-%a",
          time_format = "%H:%M",
      },
    }
<

and the file `~/my-vault/my-templates-folder/note template.md`:

>markdown
    # {{title}}
    
    Date created: {{date}}
<

creating the note `Configuring Neovim.md` and executing `:ObsidianTemplate`
will insert

>markdown
    # Configuring Neovim
    
    Date created: 2023-03-01-Wed
<

above the cursor position.

You can also define custom template substitutions with the configuration field
`templates.substitutions`. For example, to automatically substitute the
template variable `{{yesterday}}` when inserting a template, you could add this
to your config:

>lua
    {
    -- other fields ...
    templates = {
      substitutions = {
        yesterday = function()
          return os.date("%Y-%m-%d", os.time() - 86400)
        end
      }
    }
<


USAGE OUTSIDE OF A WORKSPACE OR VAULT*obsidian-usage-outside-of-a-workspace-or-vault*

It’s possible to configure obsidian.nvim to work on individual markdown files
outside of a regular workspace / Obsidian vault by configuring a "dynamic"
workspace. To do so you just need to add a special workspace with a function
for the `path` field (instead of a string), which should return a _parent_
directory of the current buffer. This tells obsidian.nvim to use that directory
as the workspace `path` and `root` (vault root) when the buffer is not located
inside another fixed workspace.

For example, to extend the configuration above this way:

>diff
    {
      workspaces = {
         {
           name = "personal",
           path = "~/vaults/personal",
         },
         ...
    +    {
    +      name = "no-vault",
    +      path = function()
    +        -- alternatively use the CWD:
    +        -- return assert(vim.fn.getcwd())
    +        return assert(vim.fs.dirname(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0)))
    +      end,
    +      overrides = {
    +        notes_subdir = vim.NIL,  -- have to use 'vim.NIL' instead of 'nil'
    +        new_notes_location = "current_dir",
    +        templates = {
    +          folder = vim.NIL,
    +        },
    +        disable_frontmatter = true,
    +      },
    +    },
    +  },
       ...
    }
<

With this configuration, anytime you enter a markdown buffer outside of
"~/vaults/personal" (or whatever your configured fixed vaults are),
obsidian.nvim will switch to the dynamic workspace with the path / root set to
the parent directory of the buffer.

Please note that in order to avoid unexpected behavior (like a new directory
being created for `notes_subdir`) it’s important to carefully set the
workspace `overrides` options. And keep in mind that to reset a configuration
option to `nil` you’ll have to use `vim.NIL` there instead of the builtin Lua
`nil` due to the way Lua tables work.
