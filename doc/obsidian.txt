*obsidian.txt*           a plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian vault

obsidian.nvim

A Neovim plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian <https://obsidian.md>
vault, written in Lua.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian ‚Äì a simple, markdown-based
notes app ‚Äì but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

_This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it._ My
personal workflow involves writing Obsidian notes in Neovim using this plugin,
while viewing and reading them using the Obsidian app. That said, this plugin
stands on its own as well. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to use it alongside the
Obsidian app.

COMMANDS                                                   *obsidian-commands*

- `:ObsidianOpen [QUERY]` to open a note in the Obsidian app. This command has
    one optional argument: a query used to resolve the note to open by ID, path, or
    alias. If not given, the note corresponding to the current buffer is opened.
- `:ObsidianNew [TITLE]` to create a new note. This command has one optional
    argument: the title of the new note.
- `:ObsidianQuickSwitch` to quickly switch to another note in your vault,
    searching by its name using ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>
    with telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>, fzf.vim
    <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>, or fzf-lua
    <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>.
- `:ObsidianFollowLink` to follow a note reference under the cursor.
- `:ObsidianBacklinks` for getting a location list of references to the current
    buffer.
- `:ObsidianToday [OFFSET]` to open/create a new daily note. This command also
    takes an optional offset in days, e.g.¬†use `:ObsidianToday -1` to go to
    yesterday‚Äôs note. Unlike `:ObsidianYesterday` and `:ObsidianTomorrow` this
    command does not differentiate between weekdays and weekends.
- `:ObsidianYesterday` to open/create the daily note for the previous working
    day.
- `:ObsidianTomorrow` to open/create the daily note for the next working day.
- `:ObsidianTemplate [NAME]` to insert a template from the templates folder,
    selecting from a list using telescope.nvim
    <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>, fzf.vim
    <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>, or fzf-lua
    <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>. See |obsidian-"using-templates"| for
    more information.
- `:ObsidianSearch [QUERY]` to search for notes in your vault using ripgrep
    <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> with telescope.nvim
    <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>, fzf.vim
    <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>, or fzf-lua
    <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>. This command has one optional argument:
    a search query to start with.
- `:ObsidianLink [QUERY]` to link an inline visual selection of text to a note.
    This command has one optional argument: a query that will be used to resolve
    the note by ID, path, or alias. If not given, the selected text will be used as
    the query.
- `:ObsidianLinkNew [TITLE]` to create a new note and link it to an inline visual
    selection of text. This command has one optional argument: the title of the new
    note. If not given, the selected text will be used as the title.
- `:ObsidianWorkspace [NAME]` to switch to another workspace.
- `:ObsidianPasteImg [IMGNAME]` to paste an image from the clipboard into the
    note at the cursor position by saving it to the vault and adding a markdown
    image link. You can configure the default folder to save images to with the
    `attachments.img_folder` option.
- `:ObsidianRename [NEWNAME] [--dry-run]` to rename the note of the current
    buffer or reference under the cursor, updating all backlinks across the vault.
    Since this command is still relatively new and could potentially write a lot of
    changes to your vault, I highly recommend committing the current state of your
    vault (if you‚Äôre using version control) before running it, or doing a dry-run
    first by appending "‚Äìdry-run" to the command, e.g.¬†`:ObsidianRename new-id
    --dry-run`.

3. Setup                                                      *obsidian-setup*


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS                             *obsidian-system-requirements*

- NeoVim >= 0.8.0 (this plugin uses `vim.fs` which was only added in 0.8).
- If you want completion and search features (recommended) you‚Äôll need ripgrep <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> to be installed and on your `$PATH`.
    See ripgrep#installation <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> for install options.

Specific operating systems also require additional dependencies in order to use
all of obsidian.nvim‚Äôs functionality:

- **Windows WSL** users need `wsl-open` <https://gitlab.com/4U6U57/wsl-open> for the `:ObsidianOpen` command.
- **MacOS** users need `pngpaste` <https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste> (`brew install pngpaste`) for the `:ObsidianPasteImg` command.
- **Linux** users need xclip (X11) or wl-clipboard (Wayland) for the `:ObsidianPasteImg` command.

Search functionality (e.g.¬†via the `:ObsidianSearch` and
`:ObsidianQuickSwitch` commands) also requires telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or one of the `fzf`
alternatives (see |obsidian-plugin-dependencies| below).


INSTALL AND CONFIGURE                         *obsidian-install-and-configure*

To configure obsidian.nvim you just need to call `require("obsidian").setup({
... })` with the desired options. Here are some examples using different plugin
managers. The full set of |obsidian-plugin-dependencies| and
|obsidian-configuration-options| are listed below.

PLUGIN DEPENDENCIES                             *obsidian-plugin-dependencies*

The only required plugin dependency is plenary.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim>, but there are a number of optional
dependencies that enhance the obsidian.nvim experience.

**Completion:**

- hrsh7th/nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp>: for completion of note references.

**Search functionality:**

- nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>: for search and quick-switch functionality.
- ibhagwan/fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>: an alternative to telescope for search and quick-switch functionality.
- junegunn/fzf <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf> and junegunn/fzf.vim <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>: another alternative to telescope for search and quick-switch functionality.

**Syntax highlighting:**

- nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>: for base markdown syntax highlighting. See |obsidian-syntax-highlighting| for more details.
- preservim/vim-markdown <https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown>: an alternative to nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting (see |obsidian-syntax-highlighting| for more details), plus other cool features.

**Miscellaneous:**

- üÜï pomo.nvim <https://github.com/epwalsh/pomo.nvim>: for running lightweight pomodoro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique> timers.

If you choose to use any of these you should include them in the "dependencies"
or "requires" field of the obsidian.nvim plugin spec for your package manager.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS                         *obsidian-configuration-options*

This is a complete list of all of the options that can be passed to
`require("obsidian").setup()`. The values represent reasonable defaults, but
please read each option carefully and customize it to your needs:

      --    but much slower and needs to be installed separately.

NOTES ON CONFIGURATION                       *obsidian-notes-on-configuration*


COMPLETION ~

obsidian.nvim will set itself up as an nvim-cmp source automatically when you
enter a markdown buffer within your vault directory, you do **not** need to
specify this plugin as a cmp source manually.

Note that in order to trigger completion for tags _within YAML frontmatter_ you
still need to type the "#" at the start of the tag. obsidian.nvim will remove
the "#" when you hit enter on the tag completion item.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING ~

If you‚Äôre using nvim-treesitter
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/README.md>
you‚Äôre configuration should include both "markdown" and "markdown_inline"
sources:

>lua
    require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
      ensure_installed = { "markdown", "markdown_inline", ... },
      highlight = {
        enable = true,
      },
    })
<

If you use `vim-markdown` you‚Äôll probably want to disable its frontmatter
syntax highlighting (`vim.g.vim_markdown_frontmatter = 1`) which I‚Äôve found
doesn‚Äôt work very well.


NOTE NAMING AND LOCATION ~

The `notes_subdir` and `note_id_func` options are not mutually exclusive. You
can use them both. For example, using a combination of both of the above
settings, a new note called "My new note" will assigned a path like
`notes/1657296016-my-new-note.md`.


GF PASSTHROUGH ~

If you want the `gf` passthrough functionality but you‚Äôve already overridden
the `gf` keybinding, just change your `gf` mapping definition to something like
this:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gf", function()
      if require("obsidian").util.cursor_on_markdown_link() then
        return "<cmd>ObsidianFollowLink<CR>"
      else
        return "gf"
      end
    end, { noremap = false, expr = true })
<

Then make sure to comment out the `gf` keybinding in your obsidian.nvim config:

>lua
    mappings = {
      -- ["gf"] = ...
    },
<

Or alternatively you could map obsidian.nvim‚Äôs follow functionality to a
different key:

>lua
    mappings = {
      ["fo"] = {
        action = function()
          return require("obsidian").util.gf_passthrough()
        end,
        opts = { noremap = false, expr = true, buffer = true },
      },
    },
<


USING TEMPLATES                                     *obsidian-using-templates*

To insert a template, run the command `:ObsidianTemplate`. This will open
telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or one of the
`fzf` alternatives and allow you to select a template from the templates
folder. Select a template and hit `<CR>` to insert. Substitution of `{{date}}`,
`{{time}}`, and `{{title}}` is supported.

For example, with the following configuration

>lua
    {
      -- other fields ...
    
      templates = {
          subdir = "my-templates-folder",
          date_format = "%Y-%m-%d-%a",
          time_format = "%H:%M",
      },
    }
<

and the file `~/my-vault/my-templates-folder/note template.md`:

>markdown
    # {{title}}
    
    Date created: {{date}}
<

creating the note `Configuring Neovim.md` and executing `:ObsidianTemplate`
will insert

>markdown
    # Configuring Neovim
    
    Date created: 2023-03-01-Wed
<

above the cursor position.

You can also define custom template substitutions with the configuration field
`templates.substitutions`. For example, to automatically substitute the
template variable `{{yesterday}}` when inserting a template, you could add this
to your config:

>lua
    {
    -- other fields ...
    templates = {
      substitutions = {
        yesterday = function()
          return os.date("%Y-%m-%d", os.time() - 86400)
        end
      }
    }

4. Known Issues                                        *obsidian-known-issues*


CONFIGURING VAULT DIRECTORY BEHIND A LINK*obsidian-configuring-vault-directory-behind-a-link*

If you are having issues with commands like `ObsidianOpen`, ensure that your
vault is configured to use an absolute path rather than a link. If you must use
a link in your configuration, make sure that the name of the vault is present
in the file path of the link. For example:

>
    Vault: ~/path/to/vault/parent/obsidian/
    Link: ~/obsidian OR ~/parent
<
